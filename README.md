The test cases documented in the file are designed to validate the core functionalities of YouTube from a user interaction perspective. They begin with launching the YouTube homepage (TC_01), ensuring that it loads correctly. Following this, the test cases proceed with basic user actions such as searching for a video using a keyword (TC_02), playing a video from the results (TC_03), and interacting with playback controls like pause and resume (TC_04). Another important functionality tested is changing the video quality through the settings menu (TC_05), verifying that the quality can be adjusted without reloading the page. Each test case includes clear steps, expected and actual outcomes, and all are marked as "Pass", indicating successful validation of YouTube's essential video browsing and playback features.
