This test case suite focuses on verifying the core functionalities of the YouTube web platform to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience. The scenarios cover essential user interactions such as launching the homepage, performing a video search, playing videos, controlling playback, and adjusting video quality. Each test case is structured with a unique ID, a clear test scenario, step-by-step execution instructions, expected results, actual results, and a final status.

The testing began with verifying successful navigation to the YouTube homepage (TC_01), followed by executing a search operation using relevant keywords (TC_02), which returned accurate and timely results. The test cases also validated video playback (TC_03) to ensure that selected videos load and play without issues. Additionally, playback control functionalities such as pausing and resuming the video were thoroughly tested (TC_04), confirming the responsiveness and reliability of YouTubeâ€™s media controls. Lastly, the ability to change video quality settings dynamically (TC_05) was tested to confirm that users can switch resolutions without interrupting playback.

All test cases passed successfully, indicating that the primary video consumption features on YouTube are functioning as intended. This test documentation demonstrates a strong understanding of user-centric testing, web application functionality validation, and clear articulation of test results.
